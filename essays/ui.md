## What's a UI Framework?
A UI Framework or a User Interface Framework is a assistance tool for programmers to be able to create web pages faster and make certain parts easier. They help to make layouts, styling, buttons, navbars, and responsive tools easier to build. Without UI Frameworks, the programmer has to code every button and layout manually and has to code the responsiveness on their own. It basically helps to provide structure and consistency since it contains many pre-built components and styles.

## Why Use a UI Framework?
One of the main reasons that UI Frameworks are used are as I mentioned, the consistent structures and layouts that it allows a programmer to create. This consistency also highly improves collaborative projects for programmers since all developers use the same types of spacing, layouts, and patterns. While the learning curve can be difficult since UI Frameworks are similar to learning a coding language in both difficulty and the time it takes to learn them. They provide an efficient and consistent source for website creation. Another big reason to use a UI Framework is the issues it can fix regarding responsiveness and browser compatibility for applications to work consistently.

## Personal Thoughts on UI Frameworks
While I don't have much experience in creating websites and using HTML or CSS, I find UI Frameworks to be useful. My first experience with a UI Framework is with Bootstrap-5 and when I first was reading through the syntax, I was very confused. I honestly am still confused but that's the tradeoff for learning a UI framework. While it requires a lot of time and effort to learn, its benefits are solid shortcuts for a lot of difficulties you'd face using HTML and CSS. I've mentioned the main positives but some of the negatives are the time that it can take to learn and that can reduce creativity for more creative and unique sites. However, I've personally found it tedious but useful and honestly pretty eye opening for me when it comes to creating website pages.
