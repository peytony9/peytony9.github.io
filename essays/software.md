From a young age, I've been surrounded by technology and its been a part of my life for a really long time. As I've grown up and learned more about how technology and computers work, I've become more interested in getting into the details and actually learning software engineering. Software engineering has become especially more interesting as more career paths open up due to the world constantly changing and moving toward a more technological reliant society. It's a subject that continues to grow leaving opportunity for new learning all the time which is perfect for a learning mindset.

Through the few classes I've been through, I've learned foundational coding skills like the basics including functions, loops, objects, variables, classes, interfaces, etc. I've worked mostly with the coding language of Java and C++ doing mini projects and assignments to get more familiar with creating code and completing simple tasks. I have also worked on runtimes and algorithms to better understand how to create code that runs in optimal time and also what functions are better in certain situations. This has built a decent foundation for me to build upon as I work through more software engineering opportunities in my college time.

As I continue to take more classes and independently work on my software engineering skills, I hope to build my skills in software engineering and grow my problem solving skills. I also want to learn more coding languages to become more well rounded in my overall ability. I plan to improve my skills and work on more projects for the future so I can build a resume for myself and prepare myself for life past college. I want to develop my ability to work with others as coding isn't just an individual thing and I want to be able to learn more about real world situations where I could put what I learned into action.
