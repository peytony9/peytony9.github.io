## View on Typescript
There are many different coding langauges when it comes to software engineering and I'm now learning typescript. This is my first time ever learning to code in Javascript or Typescript and so far it hasn't been a rough expierence. I've only really learned a bit of Java and C++ and I wouldn't say that typescript's syntax is super foreign compared to those two coding languages. The syntax being similar to what I know has allowed me to transfer my skills over in a way that hasn't had a whole lot of hiccups but I know I still have a lot to learn since I've already faced challenges and confusion but that's software engineering. I don't have a huge range of skill in software engineering but after learning typescript's basics, I find it to be a good programming language. I thought that the ES6 changes/add-ons were good for quality of life but I'm still adjusting to some of the syntax to be able to use it to it's full potential.

## Overall Learning Experience
While typescript has been a relatively smooth transition for me, I still feel like there's a lot more for me to learn. My overall software engineering skill isn't that great when it comes to using the basic typescript syntax in order to produce results or solutions in real world problems. However, I understand that this is my responsibilty to continue to work on more projects and assignments to better my skills and learn to use it in the real world. I do enjoy writing in typescript because I think that the syntax isn't too complicated the syntax provides a decent amount of helper functions to make programming easier when doing complex calcualations or annoying checks. I hope to learn more about typescript and become a more seasoned software engineer.

## Looking to the Future
As I've gone through my programming path for about two years, I've never found a solid way for me to really improve on my software engineeing skills. I've always struggled to fully grasp onto coding and I figured it's difficult and tedious so I just have to keep on coding and learning. However, recently I've been introduced to a "new" way of improving my software engineering skills, that being through athletic software engineering. Athletic software engineering consists of completing what's called a WOD (Workout of the day), this is meant to follow the same theory of improvement that athletes of any other sport follows. In order to improve at something, you have to practice it over, and over, and over again. Coding is similar and a WOD is meant to put your brain through the practice of coding consistently. In the few times that I've actually done a WOD, I found it to be really stressful since these are also timed so it forces my brain to really dive deep and try to solve a problem as fast as I can. This is pretty stressful since I've been coding with more time on my hands than what's given in the WOD's. I'm not sure if it's the best way for me individually to learn but I've played other sports and I know that consistent practice is how to improve so I'm confident that I will gain more skill and knowledge.
