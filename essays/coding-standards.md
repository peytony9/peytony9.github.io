## What's a Coding Standard?
First off, what even is a coding standard? My understanding of this topic is that a coding standard is a type of guideline set for programmers to write understandable, manageable, and correct code. These coding standards are usually things like how certain structures should be written, how to indent lines, rules for type safety, etc. They're often mutually agreed on and made to help developers with their respective coding language.

## What's the Importance of a Coding Standard?
These coding standards are often made to improve the quality of life for the coder and the quality of the overall code. One main reason these standards are made is to improve readability as codes without standards can often become bunched and unreadable. Certain standards like indents, semicolons, how to initialize variables are important to keep a code both readable and maintainable. Coding standards also often improve the ability for collaboration as codes become built around the standard so multiple programmers can work on it while being able to understand each other's work. Another main thing a coding standard does is help reduce bugs and issues in codes like how ESLint finds little errors.

## My Thoughts On Coding Standards
I've had a little bit of experience with different types of coding standards. I've coded in C++, Java, Javascript, and Typescript and I believe that coding standards are helpful while they can also be irritating. As I currently work with ESLint, it's been a good resource to help me learn the code while also work towards programming more codes that fit the coding standard. I find ESLint to be a little irritating as it can be nitpicky with certain things, but I also seen the reasoning behind the changes and it helps me to improve my future codes. Coding standards are important because without them, I think codes would become unreadable, hard to work on collaboratively, and become really unorganized so while they can be tedious, they are crucial.
