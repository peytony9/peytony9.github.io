Playing golf for the Kamehameha Varsity Golf Team taught me many different skills that are beyond golf which I can carry into my life in the future. It developed my traits of teamwork, discipline, working towards a goal, perserverance, and time management. Golf is one of the most difficult sports especially when it comes to the mental fortitude needed and I believe struggling in golf and continuing to keep working relates to how you have to approach difficult coding.
