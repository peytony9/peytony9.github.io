Last year and this current year I am playing on the Varsity UHEsports team for VALORANT. Esports is essentially competetive gaming where I've participated in tournaments for money and trophies. The program helps me to get better at the game, my teamwork, and put effort into achieving something great.

For the team, I play the role called the in-game leader. This role is essentially the most important role as I make a lot of the decisions for the team while we play our matches. I also have to look into our past games and learn from it to better prepare us for future matches. Along with this, I contribute by playing the game and practicing to improve my individual skill so the team can improve as well. It's important that I balance this hobby and responsibilty with my everyday life and school work.

Playing on this team has helped me tremendously to develop a lot of teamwork skills and leadership skills as I play the role of the in-game leader. This has helped me to work on communication under high pressure situations and deeper level thinking on putting my mind into something I have passion for. I've learned the importance of teamwork and how crucial it is to be able to work with others as it makes us all better.
