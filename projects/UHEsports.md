Last year and this current year I am playing on the Varsity UHEsports team for VALORANT. It's helped me to develop a lot of teamwork skill as well as leadership skills as I play the role of the in-game leader. This has helped me to work on communication under high pressure situations and deeper level thinking on putting my mind into something I have passion for.
